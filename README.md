## JSON-RPC support for Java

This project provides a simple Java implementation of the JSON-RPC protocol. It is designed to be easy to use and to
support all the features of the protocol. It is instrumented with metrics useful to operate a JSON-RPC interaction in a
production environment driven by a Java process.

It is designed to be compatible with JSON-RPC implementations in other languages.
